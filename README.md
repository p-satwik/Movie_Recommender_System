A simple, efficient movie recommender system built using Python and Pandas, deployed on Heroku. It leverages data from TMDB (The Movie Database) to provide movie suggestions based on user preferences.

## 🌟 Features

- **Content-Based Filtering**: Recommends movies based on similarities in genre, cast, crew, and storyline.
- **Efficient Data Handling**: Processes over 5000 movies to deliver recommendations quickly.
- **Heroku Deployment**: Easily accessible online for real-time recommendations.

## 📁 Datasets

- `tmdb_5000_movies.csv`: Contains detailed information about the movies.
- `tmdb_5000_credits.csv`: Holds cast and crew data for the movies.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **Pandas & Numpy**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Scikit-learn**: To calculate similarity and build the recommendation engine.
- **Streamlit/Flask**: (or whichever used) for the web application.
- **Heroku**: For deployment.

## 🤖 Machine Learning Techniques

- **TF-IDF Vectorization**: Used to convert text (like movie overviews) into numerical features.
- **Cosine Similarity**: Applied to measure similarity between movies based on their content.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Employed to analyze textual data such as plot overviews for content-based filtering.
